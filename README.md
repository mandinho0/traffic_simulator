# Traffic Simulator with Intelligent Agents and Accident Prediction

This is a traffic simulator project implemented in Python using SPADE agents, with the incorporation of an SVM model for accident prediction.

## Running the Simulator

To run the simulator, ensure you have Python installed. Execute the following command:

```bash: python main.py

Make sure to adjust the necessary parameters in the configuration file before running. You will need install the imported libs.
